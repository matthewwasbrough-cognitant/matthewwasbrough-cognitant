### Hello

Hi, I'm Matthew, Head of Development at Cognitant. In this role I see it as my job to be overall owner of the Cognitant p[latform, encompassing where it is now, what decisions were taken to get to the current state, and what decisions are being made to enhance it for the future. I don't expect to write all the code or make all of the decisions, but if something happens I will take the responsibility. While I try and be open, approachable, and adaptable I hope this document will give some background to where I come from and what my opinions are on a range of topics that might influence how I work. In short this is a document about me and how I work and what I expect of people who work within my team. As you read this please remember these are my opinions and thoughts at the time of writing, if something seems to be out of place to how I act then ask about it, either my opinion has changed or I'm not performing as I should. Part of the purpose of writing this is so I am accountable to those who work for me and through getting feedback I can find ways of getting better at management, leadership, and building a more inclusive, supportive, and high performing team that people want to be part of.
